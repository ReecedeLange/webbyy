        <p>Dear Siti Salma Belina Sofyandi, words cannot begin to describe what I feel towards you. I wake up each day wishing I could be a better man for you, I know we've only just touched the surface of what we have to offer each other but I need to be better. I never want to stop raising your expectations. I never want you to question my love or authenticity towards you. I know I'm being extra with all of this but I never want to have regret in my heart, I never want to think of what could've been had I been a better person. I regret so much in my life as is, I don't want you to be part of that. You deserve so much good things in this world and I hope you will allow me to be the man to give you all what you desire. There isn't much good left in this world but you? You make it feel like there is only good in this world. I only dream and pray to be part of your world until the end, until we both take our final breaths.</p>
